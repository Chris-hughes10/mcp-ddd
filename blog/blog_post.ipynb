    "# Building Scalable MCP Servers with Domain-Driven Design\n",
    "\n",
    "AI models are becoming increasingly capable, resulting in a growing need for standardized ways to connect them with our data, tools, and systems. This has become even more pressing with the explosive growth of AI agents - autonomous systems that can understand requests, plan actions, and interact with tools to complete tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, integration was often ad-hoc and inconsistent; each application required custom connectors, proprietary interfaces, and duplicated effort. Just as REST APIs standardized how web services communicate, the time has come for a common language for AI models to interact with our digital ecosystem. This is where the Model Context Protocol (MCP) comes in - an open standard that enables LLMs to interact with external resources in a structured, maintainable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether we're building a simple weather lookup tool or a complex enterprise data integration, the architecture patterns we choose will determine how well our MCP servers scale and adapt over time. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to apply [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) principles to build maintainable, scalable MCP servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note on Code Examples**: The code snippets in this post are simplified for illustration and learning purposes. Complete, runnable implementations with full error handling, logging, and configuration are available in the accompanying repository. Use the repository code as your starting point for real projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the Model Context Protocol?\n",
    "\n",
    "[The Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open standard that aims to bring consistency to how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs), providing LLMs with standardized access to external tools and data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP servers expose three main types of capabilities, each serving different interaction patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools** are functions that LLMs can actively call during their reasoning process. They perform computations, trigger actions, and can have side effects. For example, a `get_weather_forecast` tool might fetch real-time data from an API, or a `send_email` tool might trigger an actual email. Tools are discovered by the LLM at runtime, and the model decides when and how to invoke them based on the conversation context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resources** provide read-only access to data that can be loaded into the LLM's context. Unlike tools, resources are primarily informational and don't perform actions. Examples could include `file://documents/report.pdf` or `database://customers/recent_orders`. Resources can be static (fixed URIs) or dynamic (parameterized templates like `user://{user_id}/profile`). They're typically loaded by client applications rather than being called directly by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompts** are reusable templates that help users initiate specific types of conversations or workflows. They can accept parameters and return structured prompt content. For instance, a `code_review_prompt` might take a programming language and code snippet as parameters, then return a formatted prompt that guides the LLM to perform a thorough code review.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we build an MCP server, we're creating a bridge between an LLM and our specific data or functionality. For example, an LLM can use these tools to check the weather, search company documents, or analyse data - all without having these capabilities built directly into the model during training; all the model needs to know is how to use tools and resources. The beauty of MCP is its standardization - once we build a tool following the protocol, it can be used by any MCP-compatible client.\n",

    "This implementation works and provides useful weather functionality to LLMs. You can run it and connect through MCP clients to get real weather data. But as we examine the code more closely, several architectural issues become apparent:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mixed Responsibilities**: In the `get_alerts` function, business logic is directly coupled with MCP infrastructure. In just 15 lines, it's handling:\n",
    "- URL construction for external APIs\n",
    "- HTTP communication and error handling  \n",
    "- JSON parsing and data extraction\n",
    "- Business logic (what constitutes an alert)\n",
    "- Response formatting for LLM consumption\n",
    "- MCP protocol concerns (the `@mcp.tool()` decorator)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing Challenges**: How would you test the alert formatting logic? Currently, you'd need to either:\n",
    "- Make real HTTP calls to the NWS API (slow, unreliable, requires internet)\n",
    "- Mock the entire `httpx` library (complex setup, brittle tests)\n",
    "- Test everything together as an integration test (hard to isolate failures)\n",
    "\n",
    "**No Domain Model**: We're working directly with raw dictionaries from the API response. When you see `props.get(\"event\", \"Unknown\")`, what business rule does that represent? What happens if the API changes its response format?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inflexible Infrastructure**: The HTTP client is hard-coded into our business logic. What if we need to add:\n",
    "- Authentication headers for a different weather service?\n",
    "- Retry logic for rate limiting?\n",
    "- Caching to avoid redundant API calls?\n",
    "- Different timeout settings for different endpoints?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limited Reusability**: This code is tightly coupled to MCP. If you wanted to expose the same weather functionality through a REST API, CLI tool, or GraphQL endpoint, you'd need to duplicate all the business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we're losing the semantic richness of our domain. When the code processes this API response:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"properties\": {\n",
    "    \"event\": \"Heat Advisory\",\n",
    "    \"severity\": \"Moderate\", \n",
    "    \"areaDesc\": \"Harris County\",\n",
    "    \"description\": \"Heat index values up to 108 degrees...\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We immediately flatten it into a string for display. We lose the ability to:\n",
    "- Reason about alert severity levels\n",
    "- Group alerts by geographic area  \n",
    "- Store historical alert data for analysis\n",
    "- Apply business rules based on alert types\n",
    "\n",
    "These aren't just theoretical concerns - they become real limitations as requirements evolve. What happens when someone asks for \"severe weather alerts only\" or \"alerts from the past week\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Does This Matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple scripts, proof-of-concepts, or single-purpose tools, the straightforward approach shown above may be the best solution in terms of simplicity, ease of understanding and maintenance. If you're building a quick weather lookup for personal use or a prototype to demonstrate an idea, the additional complexity of Domain-Driven Design probably isn't justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, DDD's benefits emerge when building systems that need to handle:\n",
    "- **Changing requirements**: \"Now we need to support multiple weather providers\"\n",
    "- **Complex business rules**: \"Only show severe alerts during business hours\"\n",
    "- **Integration across interfaces**: The same logic needs to work in REST APIs, CLIs, and MCP servers\n",
    "- **Long-term maintenance**: The system will be modified and extended over months or years\n",
    "- **Multiple team members**: Other developers need to understand and modify the code\n",

    "## Domain-Driven Design: A Foundation for LLM Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen the limitations of the simple approach, let's explore how Domain-Driven Design can address these problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, I've applied Domain-Driven Design principles to web servers with great success, and when I first encountered the Model Context Protocol, I immediately saw how these same patterns could apply. DDD isn't just another architectural pattern â it's a way of thinking about software that puts our business domain at the centre. Instead of organizing code by technical concerns (controllers, models, views), DDD organizes it by business capabilities (weather forecasting, order processing, user management).\n",
    "\n",
    "This domain-centric approach is even more critical when working with LLMs than with traditional software. Since LLMs operate primarily through understanding context and semantics, having clearly defined domain concepts directly improves their ability to select and use the right tools appropriately. When our MCP servers are built around well-modelled domains with a consistent ubiquitous language, we provide LLMs with the precise context they need to interpret requests correctly and choose the appropriate tools, resources, or prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Weather Domain\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing any code, DDD encourages us to understand the domain we're working in. In weather forecasting, we have concepts like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forecasts**: Complete weather predictions for specific locations\n",
    "- **Periods**: Time segments within a forecast (like \"Tonight\" or \"Tuesday\")  \n",
    "- **Alerts**: Official warnings about dangerous weather conditions that were active at a specific time and location\n",
    "\n",
    "These aren't just data structures - they're meaningful concepts in our domain. When we model our software using this domain language, several things happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLMs Understand Better**: When an LLM sees a function called `get_severe_alerts()`, it immediately understands this will return serious weather threats. A function called `execute_query_for_weather_data_endpoint_with_severity_filter()` requires parsing technical jargon to understand the business purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Becomes Self-Documenting**: When you see `alert.severity == \"Extreme\"` in code, you immediately know this is handling the most serious weather threats. Raw dictionary access like `data[\"properties\"][\"severity\"] == \"Extreme\"` buries this business meaning in implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements Are Clearer**: Stakeholders can say \"We need to track severe alerts over time\" instead of \"We need to store API responses with severity properties in a database table.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a **ubiquitous language** - a common vocabulary shared between domain experts and developers - is central to DDD. In an MCP context, this language becomes the bridge between human intent, LLM understanding, and system capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### DDD Building Blocks for Our Weather Domain\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recap some DDD concepts, and apply these to our weather domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Value Objects** represent domain concepts without identity. Our `WeatherPeriod` (temperature, wind, forecast text) and `Coordinate` (latitude, longitude) are perfect examples. Two weather periods with the same data are effectively identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entities** have unique identity that persists over time. While our simple example doesn't need entities, a more complex system might have `WeatherStation` entities with unique identifiers and changing conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain Services** encapsulate business logic that doesn't naturally belong in entities or value objects. A `WeatherService` may be defined to contain the business rules for retrieving and formatting weather data - this maps perfectly to MCP tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repositories** provide collection-like interfaces for accessing domain objects. A `WeatherAlertRepository` could be used find alerts by region and time range without exposing whether they're stored in files, databases, or memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application Services** orchestrate domain objects to fulfill specific use cases while staying independent of infrastructure concerns. We could use a `WeatherMCPService` to coordinate domain services and repositories while handling MCP protocol requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Root Problem: Infrastructure Leaking Into Domain Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking back at our simple weather server, the core issue is that infrastructure concerns have leaked into business logic. The `get_alerts` function doesn't just handle the business concept of \"getting weather alerts\" - it's also responsible for HTTP communication, JSON parsing, error handling, and response formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mixing of concerns makes the code:\n",
    "- **Hard to test**: You can't verify alert logic without HTTP calls\n",
    "- **Difficult to change**: Switching APIs requires changing business logic  \n",
    "- **Impossible to reuse**: The weather logic only works within MCP\n",
    "- **Hard to understand**: Business rules are buried in infrastructure code\n",
    "\n",
    "DDD gives us patterns to separate these concerns cleanly, making our code more maintainable, testable, and adaptable to changing requirements."

The client acts as the intelligent orchestrator, bridging human intent with server capabilities.\n",

    "- This provides **historical** (not current) data\n",
    "- It's about weather **alerts** (not forecasts)  \n",
    "- It's organized by US **states** (not coordinates)\n",
    "- Parameter should be a state code (not lat/lon)\n",

    "- Contains weather-specific repository implementations that use infrastructure\n",

    "- Weather-specific business logic and data access patterns\n",
    "- Can import from infrastructure but stays focused on weather concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application Layer** (`application/`):\n",
    "- Contains `WeatherMCPService` \n",
    "- Orchestrates domain objects to fulfill use cases\n",
    "- Handles MCP protocol translation\n",
    "- Coordinates between domain services and repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "**Infrastructure Layer** (`infrastructure/`):\n",
    "- Contains generic, reusable technical components\n",
    "- HTTP clients, file I/O, serialization patterns\n",
    "- `TimestampedCollectionRepository`, `JsonFileRepository` base classes\n",
    "- Can be used by any domain, contains no weather-specific logic\n",

    "## Conclusion: Building AI Systems That Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "Domain-Driven Design and the Model Context Protocol form a powerful partnership for building maintainable AI integrations. By organizing our code around business domains rather than technical concerns, we create systems that are not only easier to understand and modify, but also provide LLMs with the clear, semantically rich interfaces they need to operate effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The patterns demonstrated hereâubiquitous language, bounded contexts, domain services, repositories, and application servicesâscale from simple weather lookups to complex enterprise integrations. As the AI ecosystem continues evolving, having these architectural foundations ensures your MCP servers can adapt and grow with changing requirements.\n",

    "\n",
    "The most important insight from this exercise is that DDD's emphasis on domain modeling aligns perfectly with what makes LLMs effective: consistent terminology, well-defined capabilities, and semantic clarity. When we build systems that speak the language of the business domain, we create interfaces that both humans and AI can understand and use effectively.\n",

    "### Looking Forward: The Future of AI Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "As AI systems become more sophisticated, the importance of well-designed integration points will only grow. The ad-hoc, tightly-coupled approaches that might work for proof-of-concepts will become maintenance nightmares in production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architectural patterns we've explored hereâclear domain boundaries, dependency injection, repository abstractions, and protocol separationâprovide a foundation that can evolve with changing requirements. Whether you're integrating with new AI models, switching data sources, or scaling to handle enterprise workloads, these patterns ensure your systems remain flexible and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether we are building your first MCP server or refactoring existing AI integrations, remember that the time invested in proper domain modeling and clean architecture pays dividends in maintainability, testability, and the overall quality of AI interactions with your systems. The future of AI integration lies not in ad-hoc connections, but in thoughtfully designed systems that bridge the gap between human intent and machine capability through shared domain understanding."
